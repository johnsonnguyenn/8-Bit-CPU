# 8-Bit-CPU Design

## Description
8 bit CPU design that was built using VHDL, and an Altera FPGA board. CPU integrates specific components such as registers, finite state machines, a 3-8 decoder, and ALU's

## Key Features
<b>Simulation:</b> All testing was verified using VHDL's waveforms to ensure timing was correct<br> 
<b>Seven Segment Display:</b> All results were displayed in a seven segment display, which showed operation outputs and digits <br>
<b>Functionality:</b> Implemented specific ALU operations such as bit manipulation, maximum/minimum value determination

## Technologies used
<b>VHDL</b><br>
<b>Quartus</b><br>
<b>Altera FPGA Cyclone II</b><br>
